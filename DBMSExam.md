#### Key
* Superkey is the combination of one or many attribute that can uniquely identify one entity of entityset.  
* candidatekey is the minimum superkey that is uniquely identify the entity of entityset.  
* primary key is the only one key candidate key that choose by the database desirer or DBA as the mean of identify an entity.  
* alternate key is the candidate key that haven't choose by the database adminstrator.  
##### Type of key 
* unique, composite key, surrogate 
* unique key is the key that contain unique value cannot duplicate, cannot updatable, and can contain null value.
* surrogate key is the key that cannot contain unique value bu cannot contain null value and updatable.
* composite key is primary key that contain more than one attribute.  
#### mappint cardinality
* one to one : one entity in entity set  A is associated in only one entity in entity set in B. and one entity in entity set in B can associated with only one entity in entity set in A.  
* one to many : one entity in entity set  A is associated with zero or more entity in entity set in B. and one entity in entity set in B can associated with only one entity in entity set in A.  
* many to one : one entity in entity set  A is associated in only one entity in entity set in B. and one entity in entity set in B can associated with zero or more entity in entity set in A.  
* many to many : one entity in entity set  A is associated in zero or more entity in entity set in B. and one entity in entity set in B can associated with zero or more entity in entity set in A.  
#### Relationship and relationshipset  
* Relationship is the entity is the association amount several entity  
* Relationship set is the set of relationship of the same type.  
#### E-R Diagram
* ER diagram can express the overall logical structure of a database graphically.
* there are 8 major component of ER diagram are: 
* Rectangle is represent the Entity 
* ellipse is represent the attribute 
* Diamond is representing the relationship 
* line denote the link
* double ellipse is denote the multi value attribute
* double line denote total participation
* dash ellipse denote the derive attribute
* Double rectangle denote weak entity set 
* symbol in ER Diagram
* double diamond is weak relationship set

#### mapping in cardinality in er diagram
#### Classification of Entity sets
1. total participate
2. partial participate
#### Relationship Degree
1. binary relationship set
2. ternary relationship set 
3. N-nary relationship set
#### relationship classification == mapping caldinality
